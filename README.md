# SummerProjects-CS3750

This repository contains three classic games implemented using React: Connect Four, Hangman, and Tic-Tac-Toe. Each game is fully functional, with responsive interfaces and straightforward gameplay.

# Games Overview

**1. Connect Four**

Connect Four is a classic two-player connection game in which players take turns dropping colored discs into a grid. The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. I developed the core logic that allows players to drop discs into a grid, check for a winner, and handle turns between the two players. I implemented the win condition checks, including horizontal, vertical, and diagonal connections, and styled the game board for a clean and user-friendly experience.

In the example above, Player X wins by connecting four discs in a row.

**2. Hangman (Group Project)**

Hangman was a group project, where I collaborated with others to create a word-guessing game. My specific contributions included integrating the user interface with the backend logic, ensuring that guessed letters were correctly handled and displayed, and managing the game state transitions.

Unfortunately, the player got hanged! The hidden word was "buried."

**3. Tic-Tac-Toe**

For the Tic-Tac-Toe game, I implemented the game logic, including the handling of player moves, checking for winning conditions, and displaying the game outcome. I also ensured that the game interface was responsive and intuitive, allowing for seamless gameplay.

In this round, Player X wins by forming a line vertically in the first column.

**Description**: The Banking App is a secure web application designed to manage user accounts, handle transactions, and provide role-based access. The project was developed as a group effort, with each member contributing specific functionalities.

**My Contributions**:
  - **Frontend Development**: I developed the transaction history page, which displays all transaction records, and the balances page, which shows the current balances across different accounts.
  - **Data Fetching and Session Management**: Implemented data fetching from the backend and handled session management to ensure secure and accurate data retrieval.

**Key Features**:
  - Role-based access with Administrator, Employee, and Customer roles
  - Secure transaction management including deposits, withdrawals, and transfers
  - Comprehensive account management with detailed transaction history
